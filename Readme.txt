Project
Problem 1
Example:
Linkedin API, FED API
Linkedin现在缺少通过H1B作为filter的搜索功能，
我们通过在Linkedin上搜索工作岗位，在FED里以工作岗位和H1B作为filter来搜索所有的公司名称，然后返回Linkedin match up公司名称，并给出结果。 

Project Title: Enhancement of LinkedIn’s Job Search Capabilities Using H1B Filter
Background: LinkedIn is a widely-used professional networking platform that provides various search functionalities for job seekers, such as filtering by location, industry, and experience level. However, it currently lacks a specific filter for H1B-sponsored jobs. This project aims to enhance LinkedIn's job search capabilities by integrating an H1B sponsorship filter. By searching job postings on LinkedIn, and utilizing a third-party tool or method, the project will filter results by H1B sponsorship and job titles in the Front-End Development (FED) field. The process will return company names that match the criteria, providing a more refined search experience for users seeking H1B opportunities.
Outcome: A system that offers a user interface to filter job postings based on H1B sponsorship and job titles, helping users find relevant opportunities on LinkedIn more efficiently.
